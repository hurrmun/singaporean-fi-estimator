## Why I made this

As someone who recently got into personal finance, I found it a hassle to keep track of multiple accounts to plan my financial roadmap. Having seen compound interest calculators on other sites, I felt I could improve the experience for other like-minded users.

That was when I came up with the idea of creating a FI planner specifically for Singaporeans, who have a very unique savings system, on top of being financially and digitally savvy. I feel like this could be a useful tool to motivate Singaporeans to plan their financial future, and be a good first step for people new to this concept.

## How to Use

Simply key in your investment horizon (in years) and add as many accounts as you want. You can key in an initial amount, your monthly deposit, and expected annual interest. When you are ready, click "Calculate Accounts" to see a detailed overview of how much your net worth grows each year, a graph of the accounts, and your final amount at the end of your investment horizon.
